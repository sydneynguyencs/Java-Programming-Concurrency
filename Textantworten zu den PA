a. deadlock through cyclic waiting condition. reduce waiting time to get faster deadlock.
c. Verhindern des Deadlocks Ã¼ber die Nummerierung der Ressourcen:
    Prevent cyclic waiting condition:
    Breaking the cycle by making one node (here: Phylosopher) acquiring
    the left fork first, then the right fork.
    All other Philosophers try to acquire the right fork first, then the left fork.
    The idea is based on the lecture slides 06_Concurrency3_Deadlocks on slide 29.
